# World IA Day Code of Conduct

## Support for event organizers

The World IA Day Code of Conduct is committed to providing a safe, harassment-free environment for all WIAD events. If someone reports harassment or other abuse at a WIAD event, an appropriate response is essential. This guide is intended to help all parties involved navigate the process of handling the complaint.

As an event organizer, it's best that you set up a Code of Conduct committee that will handle any Code of Conduct violations at the event. It's very important that your attendees feel and are protected at your event. Be sure you have a good understanding of WIAD’s Code of Conduct and attendee instructions for making a complaint, which can be found on the World IA Day website.

Establishing and enforcing Code of Conduct at events is not easy. Here is how the WIAD Code of Conduct committee can help event organizers to ensure safe environments at events.

A few things to remember:
- All participants at an event are covered by our Code of Conduct, including attendees, organizers, vendors, sponsors, speakers, and volunteers.
- Law enforcement should be called if there is physical danger to any attendees or if the person making the complaint requests it.
- Details of all incidents (including the identities of those involved) should be considered highly confidential and only released with consent of parties.
- All harassment incidents should be reported to World IA Day leadership, even if the details are anonymized.

### Before the event

* We advise that you share the list of attendees with us such that we are able to check it against our list of Code of Conduct offenders. If any of the attendees appears on our list as flagged or banned, we will inform you about this.

* Similarly, before you announce your accepted speakers, you can send us the speaker list to see if any appear on our lists.

* Note that we can only tell you whether or not someone appears in our records as flagged or banned. We don't guarantee that people have never violated a Code of Conduct, as we won't inform you of minor incidents, and records of minor incidents are expunged after some time. We also don't do any research beyond our own lists.

* If you have any trouble with setting up a Code of Conduct policy for your event, reach out to us and we will be able to help you through the process of creating one.

### During the event

If you encounter a Code of Conduct violation at your event that needs to be addressed immediately, you can reach out to us and we will try to help you through the processing of resolving it.

1. All WIAD organizers and volunteers should be clearly identifiable, e.g. wearing badges or shirts or having some kind of identifier in online environments.
2. They should be briefed about WIAD’s Code of Conduct and guide for handling incidents.
3. WIAD organizers and volunteers should be well informed on how to deal with an incident and how to further proceed with the situation.
4. When reporting an incident, WIAD organizers and volunteers are asked to gather as much information as available, but not to interview people in the moment. Their role at that point is to assist the person making the complaint in submitting a report.
5. If at all possible, all reports should be made directly to the event organizer, WIAD Global Executive Producer, President(s) or Safety and Conduct chair as soon as possible.


### After the event

Events in the World IA Day community are strongly encouraged to keep reports  on all Code of Conduct incidents they handle, and send these reports to the committee after the end of the event. Reports should include names of people involved and, ideally, a description of the facts determined by 
the conference team, the review of the incident, actions taken, and responses to actions taken. We also appreciate any screenshots of original messaging platform (Slack, Discord, etc) or social media platform (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) messages, or recordings of talks, that show the violation, and  copies of message exchanges between the team and any reporters or bad actors.

Upon receiving reports from a conference, the committee will:
- Confirm receipt of the reports to the conference
- Review all reports
- Assess whether any additional action from the committee is needed
- Record all reports in the committee’s records

Reporting any (even resolved) Code of Conduct violations to us helps us create one, central record of incidents to help all events be more safe.

### What information to gather

1. Identifying information (name/company) of the person committing the Code of Conduct violation. Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. 
2. The behavior that is considered in violation. An account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a Slack/Discord message or an online event chat log), include a link or file.
3. When and where the incident occurred. Be as specific as possible.
4. The circumstances surrounding the incident. 
5. Other people involved in the incident
