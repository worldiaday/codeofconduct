# Code of Conduct
World IA Day is dedicated to the empowerment of local leaders. Our events inspire the global growth of information architecture as a community of practice. We are dedicated to bringing a diversity of thoughts and thinkers.

Volunteers all over the world are working hard to bring this amazing event to their hometowns. Our community is growing rapidly, with an estimated 4000 attendees in 2015 attending in 38 cities.  

No matter where in the world you are, we want to make sure that World IA Day is a safe experience for all to volunteer for, attend, and speak at.

The Board of Directors of the Information Architecture Institute have drafted the below code of conduct to be agreed to and upheld by any member of the global and local volunteer teams. This code of conduct applies to all volunteers, all locations, all attendees, and all speakers of World IA Day.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants, speakers or volunteers in any form.

Our local teams are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any context revolving around World IA Day, including talks, parties, social media and other online media.

If anyone in the World IA Day community engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, the local organizer or Global team may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling the offender from World IA Day service or attendance.

## We’re listening.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns regarding the conduct of our global team, local teams, speakers, or attendees, please contact safety@worldiaday.org where a member of our global staff is dedicated to assisting all locations. They are trained in how to address and report any incidences brought to their attention. All reports will be handled in the strictest confidence.

## Should I report it?
If you answer “yes” to any of the following, please let us know.
* Do you feel unsafe or fear that someone else does?
* Do you have prior conduct-violating experience with members of our community that deters your participation in our event?
* Are you concerned about the appropriateness of language being used, views being expressed or the materials being shared at any of our events or via our social media channels?
* Did you witness something that you are not sure is appropriate based on our code of conduct?

## What happens if I report something?
* First we will listen.
* Then, we will help you to determine the options that we have based on the situation. We will also document the details to assure trends of behavior are uncovered across locations.
* Lastly, we will follow the situation to a resolution where you feel safe and you can remain anonymous if you wish to be.
