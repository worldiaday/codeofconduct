# Code of Conduct
World IA Day is dedicated to the empowerment of local leaders. Our events inspire the global growth of information architecture as a community of practice. World IA Day is dedicated to bringing a diversity of thoughts and thinkers.

Volunteers all over the world are working hard to bring this amazing event to their communities. Diversity and inclusion make the World IA Day community strong. World IA Day encourages participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about expectations and conduct.

No matter where in the world you are, World IA Day is a safe experience for all to volunteer for, attend, and speak at.

The Board of Directors of the Information Architecture Institute have drafted the below code of conduct to be agreed to and upheld by any member of the global and local volunteer teams. This code of conduct applies to all volunteers, all locations, all attendees, and all speakers of World IA Day.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants, speakers or volunteers in any form.

World IA Day is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

## Unacceptable behavior
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any context revolving around World IA Day, including talks, parties, social media and other online media.

If anyone in the World IA Day community engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, the local organizer or Global Safety & Conduct team may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling the offender virtually and physically from World IA Day service or attendance.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## We’re listening.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns regarding the conduct of our global team, local teams, speakers, or attendees, please contact safety@worldiaday.org where a member of the [Safety & Conduct committee][https://guides.worldiaday.org/get-involved/committees/safety] is dedicated to assisting all locations. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

To report an incident, take one of the following actions: 
* inform the event organizer on site; 
* inform another organizer in your network; 
* report the incident to World IA Day Global by completing our [incident report form][https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeQXaVPXLWTkODW4dJWRcjKTpt3MphWy5unEYP5r8xxiXrVA/viewform?usp=sf_link]. 

If you prefer anonymous reporting or would like for World IA Day Global to address the issue, please use the [incident report form][https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeQXaVPXLWTkODW4dJWRcjKTpt3MphWy5unEYP5r8xxiXrVA/viewform?usp=sf_link]. If you choose to share your name on the form, it will only be seen by the World IA Day Safety and Conduct committee involved with resolving the issue.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Should I report it?
If you answer “yes” to any of the following, please let us know.
* Do you feel unsafe or fear that someone else does?
* Do you have prior conduct-violating experience with members of our community that deters your participation in our event?
* Are you concerned about the appropriateness of language being used, views being expressed or the materials being shared at any of our events or via our social media channels?
* Did you witness something that you are not sure is appropriate based on our code of conduct?

## What happens if I report something?
The following is a summary based on where and when you make a report.
* First we will listen.
* Then, we will help you to determine the options that we have based on the situation. We will also document the details to assure trends of behavior are uncovered across locations.
* Lastly, we will follow the situation to a resolution where you feel safe and you can remain anonymous if you wish to be.  

### If you make a report at the event
Event organizers should offer you the use of a private space, explain in detail what the possible outcomes are and what will be asked of you, listen to your report, and interview other people (witnesses, the person the report is about) as necessary. It is up to the local event organizers to decide whether immediate action needs to be taken. 

After the event, the report and any actions taken will be reviewed by the World IA Day Safety and Conduct committee. This group will determine whether multiple-year action also needs to be taken. You will be informed of any action that World IA Day takes in connection with your report.

### If you email or report an incident in after the event
The World IA Day Safety and Conduct chair will receive your report and assign two responders to you. They will explain in detail what the possible outcomes are and what will be asked of you, read your report, and interview other people (witnesses, the person the report is about) as necessary. They will then bring all collected information to the Safety and Conduct committee chair, who will convene a working group that will include both responders. This working group will determine whether any action needs to be taken. You will be informed of any action that World IA Day takes in connection with your report.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## What won't happen if I make a report?

We will not reveal your identity or the substance of your report unless it is absolutely necessary to obtain information about the incident or take action related to the incident. 

We will not take any sort of retaliatory action against you for reporting or not reporting a problem.

We will not provide mediation or intermediary communication services.

While we will always err on the side of safety and treating all reports as true, we will not assume that a report being made automatically means that action needs to be taken.

## What will happen if someone says I caused a problem?
If someone tells us that you have violated the code of conduct, two event representatives will ask to speak with you about it in a private place.

If you decline to be interviewed, we may ask you to leave the event/community space. If, after speaking with you, we believe that you have violated the code of conduct, we may ask you to change your behavior or leave the community, or take other actions. We will not take action until we've spoken with you and anyone else involved and done our best to get a clear picture of what happened. 

If we believe that no violation occurred, you are welcome to go about the community space as usual. We will not attempt to mediate or carry messages between you and the person who made the report. If someone deliberately makes a false report about you, that is itself a code of conduct violation and we will take appropriate action in response.
