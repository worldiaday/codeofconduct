# World IA Day Code of Conduct
The Safety & Conduct committee deals with violoations of the World IA Day, Inc. Code of Conduct, used at World IA Day events and community at large (mailing lists, discussion forums, chat, social media, etc.).

> **Note**
> Drafting this document posed a unique challenge. Most similar guides are written on the assumption of an in-person event. However, the World IA Day community doesn't exist in one place; we host events locally and regionally, in-person and remotely.  We are spread out across the world and interact online. We have varying degrees of understanding on what is acceptable based on cultural and environmental contexts. This makes trying to define and enforce a code of conduct or set community standards a different type of challenge. There is still a lot we're figuring out and learning as we go, so we don't consider this documentation to be finished or complete.

## Events
If you are organizing a World IA Day event, you should adopt and provide an appropriate code of conduct with contact information for attendees to get help or report a violation. You may also direct event participants to the global Code of Conduct provided by the global team at World IA Day. 
See [Support for event organizers](events.md)

## Periodic Review
World IA Day strives to create a positive and inclusive environment. As such, the World IA Day Safety and Conduct committee is committed to an annual review of the Code of Conduct to ensure that it continues to align with this goal and address the needs of our community. World IA Day welcomes feedback from its members. All feedback should be submitted to the committee by emailing: safety@worldiaday.org
