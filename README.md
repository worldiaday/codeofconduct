# World IA Day Code of Conduct
This repository contains the World IA Day, Inc. Code of Conduct, used at World IA Day events and community at large (mailing lists, discussion forums, chat, social media, etc.).

## Events
If you are organizing a World IA Day event, you should adopt and provide an appropriate code of conduct with contact information for attendees to get help or report a violation. You may also direct event participants to the global Code of Conduct provided by the global team at World IA Day. 

## Periodic Review

As such, the World IA Day [Safety and Conduct committee][https://guides.worldiaday.org/get-involved/committees/safety] is committed to an annual review of the Code of Conduct to ensure that it continues to align with this goal and address the needs of our community.
