# World IA Day Code of Conduct: Membership

## Structure of membership in the committee
Members of the Safety and Conduct committee are all volunteers, and we're always aiming to have high representation of people coming from different places and backgrounds. There is no set number of people required to be on the committee at the moment. Committee tries to keep the number as small as possible due to sensitivity of the matter, but big enough to achieve diversity of the views and fast response time to incoming reports.

Whenever there is a need to add new members, committee reviews proposals from people who volunteered thus far but are not on the committee yet. If that number is still too low, a call for volunteers is published on World IA Day blog.

### Current members of the committee: 

- Andrew Jung
- Anita Cheng
- Celeste Espinoza
- Grace Lau

### Past members of the committee:

- Amy Espinosa

### Terms of membership
Each member of the committee is obligated to serve on the committee for a fixed period of time, with 9 months being a default term. When the membership term ends, the invitation to stay in the committee is automatically extended, but member has to confirm that they are indeed still interested and have time to serve on the committee (opt-in).
